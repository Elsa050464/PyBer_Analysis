# PyBer_Analysis
Pyber Analysis 
## 1. Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project is to analyze, interpret and visualize data gathered from PyBer, a ridesharing company. We will use certain programming techniques to perform exploratory analysis for the 3 cities that the company are doing business-Urban, Suburban and Rural. By using these datasets, we will be able to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the respective cities. Also, these data were used to study a more in-depth analysis in the weeks from January 1 to April 29, 2019, presented using multiple-line graph. These metrics and visualization were used to provide recommendations to the CEO of Pyber to further improve the accessibility and affordability among city types.
## 2. Results:
The following metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

### In reviewing the data, several findings were observed: 
#### •	Urban cities have the most drivers but the average fare per ride per driver are also the least
#### •	Drivers in the Rural areas have the average fare per ride and driver followed by suburban cities. 
#### •	It is interesting to see that per summary data, as reflected, shows the inverse relationship between the total number of drivers and the average fare per ride per driver

## 3. Summary:
#### •	There is a high demand for more drivers in the Rural and Suburban cities as compared to urban cities as reflected by the fare per ride and average fare per driver 
#### •	There should be a further analysis on what drives the higher fares for rural drivers e.g. Law of Supply and Demand or maybe travel distance 
#### •	Rideshare is still a lucrative business
